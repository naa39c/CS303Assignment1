My main is commented on sections where you can clearly and easily change numbers to test your own. Attached to the file is screenshots of the first attempt. They are labled with the header Q1. The Q1 files are labled normally. the Q2 is labled as such. 
The code can be ran by downloading the files, or copying the text and pasting into same named files. 
The header is used to define the functions utilized. I created my own class as I believe we were told not to use the default array. The variables in main can be easily switched out for testing, as well as the max number of items in the array allowed. Each function in the header is properly commented, so any questions should be answered there. Apologies for the mess of files, it was my first time uploading submissions to be organized in Github
